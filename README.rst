Elemental
=========


    Elemental makes Selenium automation faster and easier.


**Adds common use-cases**

Common use-cases missing from Selenium are built into Elemental. *Get an input
by its label or placeholder*? Can do. *Get a button by its text or type?* Sure.
*Get the fourth element in a list?* No problem.

**Automatic waiting**

Elemental has built-in automatic waiting so that your automation is less flaky.
It has a sensible default which can be overriden when necessary.

**The full power of Selenium**

For complex operations which require the full power of the Selenium, Elemental
gives you easy access to 100% of Selenium's API.

**Terse, clean API**

Write less code than you would if you were using Selenium directly. The
Elemental API is terse and internally consistent while still being explicit and
unambiguous.


The power of Elemental

.. code:: python

    import elemental

    # Set up.
    browser = elemental.Browser()

    # Search PyPI for Elemental.
    browser.visit("https://www.pypi.org")
    browser.get_input(placeholder="Search projects").fill("elemental")
    browser.get_button(type="submit").click()

    # Click the first search result.
    browser.get_element(partial_text="elemental").click()

    # Confirm that Elemental's PyPI page was found.
    assert browser.title == "elemental Â· PyPI"

    # Tear down.
    browser.quit()
