Elemental
=========


    Elemental makes Selenium automation faster and easier.


**Adds common use-cases**

Common use-cases missing from Selenium are built into Elemental. *Get an input
by its label or placeholder*? Can do. *Get a button by its text or type?* Sure.
*Get an element's parent?* Yep. *Get the fourth element in a list?* No problem.

**Automatic waiting**

Elemental has built-in automatic waiting so that your automation is less flaky.
It has a sensible default which can be overriden when necessary.

**The full power of Selenium**

For complex operations which require the full power of the Selenium, Elemental
gives you easy access to 100% of Selenium's API.

**Terse, clean API**

Write less code than you would if you were using Selenium directly. The
Elemental API is terse and internally consistent while still being explicit and
unambiguous.

    # Search PyPI for Elemental.
    browser.visit("https://www.pypi.org")
    browser.get_input(placeholder="Search projects").fill("elemental")
    browser.get_button(type="submit").click()

    # Click the first search result.
    browser.get_element(partial_text="elemental").click()

    # Confirm that Elemental's PyPI page was found.
    assert browser.title == "elemental Â· PyPI"

    # Tear down.
